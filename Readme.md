# Java Fundamentals Practice

This repository contains a collection of Java programs that demonstrate fundamental concepts in the Java programming language. It's intended for beginners who are learning Java and want to explore basic syntax, data types, operators, and other core features.

## Files Included

This repository includes the following Java files:

*   [**`ArithmeticExpressions.java`**](/ArithmeticExpressions.java): Examples demonstrating different arithmetic operations and how to construct arithmetic expressions in Java.
*   [**`Array.java`**](/Array.java): Shows how to declare, initialize, and manipulate single-dimensional arrays in Java.
*   [**`Casting.java`**](/Casting.java): Illustrates explicit and implicit type casting between different primitive data types.
*   [**`Contants.java`**](/Contants.java): Demonstrates how to declare and use constant variables in Java using the `final` keyword.
*   [**`Escape_Sequences.java`**](/Escape_Sequences.java): Provides examples of using escape sequences in strings for special characters.
*   [**`FormattingNumbers.java`**](/FormattingNumbers.java): Explores ways to format numbers (e.g., currency, percentages) for output.
*   [**`Main.java`**](/Main.java): This is a basic main method file that contains simple code.
*   [**`MathOperation.java`**](/MathOperation.java): Illustrates commonly used math functions provided by java standard library.
*   [**`MultiDimensionArray.java`**](/MultiDimensionArray.java): Shows how to create and work with multi-dimensional arrays.
*   [**`OrderOfOperations.java`**](/OrderOfOperations.java): Demonstrates the precedence of operators in Java expressions.
*   [**`Pri_Vs_Ref.java`**](/Pri_Vs_Ref.java): Compares primitive data types with reference types, specifically focusing on their way of storing data and variable assignation.
*   [**`Primitive_Types.java`**](/Primitive_Types.java):  Examples of using all of the primitive data types, explaining their ranges, sizes, and default values.
*   [**`ReadInput.java`**](/ReadInput.java): Shows how to read input from the user using the `Scanner` class.
*   [**`Reference_Type.java`**](/Reference_Type.java): Explains the core of reference type, such as object initialization and object type variables.
*   [**`Strings.java`**](/Strings.java): Examples of how to create, compare, and manipulate Strings using String class.
*   [**`Variable.java`**](/Variable.java): Demonstrates how to declare and use variables with different data types.
*   [**`ComparisonOperator.java`**](/ComparisonOperator.java): Examples of using comparison operators to compare values in Java.
*   [**`LogicalOperator.java`**](/LogicalOperators.java): Examples of using logical operators to combine multiple conditions in Java.
*   [**`TernaryOperator.java`**](/TernaryOperator.java): Examples of using the ternary operator to write concise conditional expressions in Java.
*   [**`IfStatements.java`**](/IfStatements.java): Examples of using if statements to execute code based on a condition in Java.
*   [**`Simplifying_IF_Statements.java`**](/Simplifying_IF_Statements.java): Examples of simplifying if statements using logical operators and ternary operators.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TajwarSaiyeed/programming-with-java
    ```
    (Replace `[YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.)
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd HelloWorld
    ```
3.  **Compile Java files:**
    ```bash
    javac src/*.java
    ```
4.  **Run the programs:**
    To run a program, such as `ReadInput.java`, execute:
     ```bash
       java src/ReadInput
    ```
    (Replace `ReadInput` with the name of the main class of the Java program you want to execute.)

5.  **Quick Testing:** If you'd like to test a code snippet quickly without setting up a local environment, you can use an online Java compiler such as [Online Java Compiler](https://www.programiz.com/java/online-compiler/).

## About the Code

*   Each file focuses on a specific concept to ensure clarity and easy understanding.
*   Comments are included in each file to explain the code and logic.
